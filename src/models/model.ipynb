    "# NBA Game Outcome Prediction Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project, I wanted to analyze NBA game data to build predictive models that can determine game outcomes based on in-game statistics. The dataset I'm using provides detailed \"snapshots\" of games at regular time intervals, tracking the score, time remaining, and other metrics throughout each game. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a basketball fan, I've always been fascinated by the concept of win probability and how it fluctuates during games. Commentators often discuss how certain moments are \"turning points\" in games, but I wanted to explore this analytically. My goal is to determine how accurately we can predict the final outcome of an NBA game based on the state of the game at various time points, and to identify which factors are most important in making these predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build machine learning models that can accurately predict which team will win an NBA game based on in-game statistics like score differential, time remaining, period, and other features in my dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Analyze how win probability evolves throughout games and determine at what point in games predictions become reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare the performance of different machine learning approaches (logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, etc) to see which works best for this prediction task.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Identify key moments or thresholds during games that have the strongest correlation with final outcomes - essentially finding the statistical \"point of no return\" in NBA games.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe this analysis will provide interesting insights into basketball game dynamics and potentially reveal patterns that aren't obvious to casual observers of the game."

    "    Handling Missing Values in Overtime Games:\n",
    "Upon initial exploration, I identified 1,792 missing values in my dataset's scoring-related features. Further investigation revealed a systematic pattern: these missing values occurred exclusively in overtime periods (specifically when games reached a 5th period).\n",
    "The missing data spans from the 12:00 to 5:30 mark (minutes and seconds remaining) or equivalently from the 0 to 390th second mark of overtime periods. This pattern exists because NBA overtime periods are only 5 minutes long, rather than the standard 12 minutes of regular quarters.\n",
    "Since overtime games constitute a relatively small proportion of my dataset, there aren't enough unique overtime period snapshots to enable reliable model training for these scenarios. Therefore, to maintain data consistency and model reliability, I decided to exclude all overtime games from my analysis. This approach allows me to focus on regulation-time game dynamics while eliminating the missing value issue entirely, rather than implementing imputation methods that might introduce bias into the overtime period data."
