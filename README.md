# NBA-Game-Outcomes-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-Based-on-Real-Time-Score-Differentials


Key Features That Drive Predictive Power

Score differential: The most important predictor
Time remaining: Transforms the meaning of the score differential
Score differential / time remaining ratio: A 10-point lead with 1 minute left is more significant than with 10 minutes left
Home/away status: Home teams have historical advantages in close games
Team strength metrics: Season win percentage or team ratings (if available)



Practical Implementation Considerations
For a Class Project:
I recommend a straightforward approach with regular intervals every minute plus quarter boundaries:

Creates manageable 50-60 snapshots per game
Sufficient granularity for modeling patterns
With 1,000 games, you'd have ~50,000 training examples (ample data)

Addressing Class Size Imbalance
With this approach, you'll have a class imbalance challenge:

Late-game snapshots where one team is far ahead will be near-certain outcomes (99%+ probability)
This creates an imbalanced dataset with many "obvious" predictions

Solutions:

Weight your training examples inversely to prediction certainty
Stratify your sampling to ensure competitive games are well-represented
Acknowledge this in your analysis (games with large leads late are naturally predictable)

Final Recommendation
For your class project, I recommend:

Every 1 minute of game time (48 snapshots per regulation game)
Plus snapshots at each quarter boundary
For approximately 1,000 games (or 2-3 seasons)

This gives you ~50,000 training examples - plenty for your models while keeping data collection and processing manageable for a class project.
